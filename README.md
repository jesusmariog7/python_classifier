# python_classifier
This notebook uses historical dataset from previous loan applications to create a loan classifier, through different algorithms:  

- KNN
- Decision Tree
- SVM
- Logistic Regression

The following metrics are used to report the accuracy of each classifier:

- Jaccard index
- F1-score
- LogLoass

Summary of steps involved: 
1- Feature selection and preprocessing of training dataset 
2- Split training dataset into train/test. 
3- Oversampling imbalanced class on training dataset. 
4- Creation of models with training data. 
5 -Evaluate and choose the best hyperparameters in each model
5- Preprocessing of test dataset 
6- Predictions using test dataset in each model
